- 👋 Hi, I’m mostly working on Web3 open-source projects: [MDearth](https://mdearth.io)
- 👀 I’m interested in a sort of Web3 application called "dApp", especially some [Awesome Web3 Projects](https://github.com/Awesome-Thinkings/Awesome-Web3) that could help people understand and be involved in the Web3 world.
- 🌱 I’m currently maintaining two open-source organizations: [MERN-Projects](https://github.com/MERN-Entrepreneur-Projects) and [Awesome-Thinkings](https://github.com/Awesome-Thinkings).
